# Arrays Lab

## Learning Goals

- Work with arrays

## Instructions

Create an input loop that asks the user to enter the names of 10 students that
will be added to a `String` array you created. Once all 10 student names have
been added (one by one), go through the array to display each student's name

Your output should look similar to this:

```java
Enter student's name:
James
Enter student's name:
Valerie
Enter student's name:
Alex
Enter student's name:
Joan
Enter student's name:

Enter student's name:
Denzel
Enter student's name:
Sarav
Enter student's name:
Sandra
Enter student's name:
Ahmed
Enter student's name:

You have entered the following names:
James
Valerie
Alex
Joan
Rebecca
